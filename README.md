DbContext has been around a while, now let's make a custome DBContext base on the one provied by Entity Framework. The code provided here is based on the scenario that you want to provide a DbContext that handles query logging, command timeout, and set read uncommitt connections. Of course you can download this code and modify it as you please. 

I'm using Entify Framework and NLOG are my main depedencies.
